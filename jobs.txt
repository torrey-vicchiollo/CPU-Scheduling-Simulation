shit we forogt about --------------
- The users can select the scheduling algorithm to run (FCFS, RR, SJF, or PS). They
can use the same scenario and run with each scheduling algorithm. Each time the user
changes the algorithm, the program resets the state and statistics.
- After each simulation, your program can ask the users to save the execution logs and
system performance metrics for that run.
